I studied computer science at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch) and specialised in information security during my master studies.

Currently, I work as a Junior Security Engineer at [Futurae](https://futurae.com), an ETH Spin-off where we build secure and usable two-factor authentication. 
At [SIB](https://www.sib.ch/) I teach the IT-Security course for their Chief Digital Officer postgraduate studies.

Before, I worked as a Web Engineer at [UniversitätsSpital Zürich](http://www.usz.ch) and [ABZ](http://www.abz.inf.ethz.ch/), and was the webmaster for [bauenschweiz](https://www.bauenschweiz.ch).

I love to play the clarinet, swim in the Zürichsee, read books or play Dungeons & Dragons with friends.
