I studied computer science at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch) and specialized in Information Security during my master studies.

Currently, I work as a Security Engineer at Google. At [SIB](https://www.sib.ch/), I teach the IT-Security lecture as part of their Chief Digital Officer postgraduate studies.

Before, I worked as a Junior Security Engineer at [Futurae](https://futurae.com), an ETH Spin-off where I helped building secure and usable Two-Factor Authentication. 
I also worked as a Web Engineer at [UniversitätsSpital Zürich](http://www.usz.ch) and [ABZ](http://www.abz.inf.ethz.ch/) and was the webmaster for [bauenschweiz](https://www.bauenschweiz.ch).
