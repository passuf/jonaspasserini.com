      <description>I studied computer science at ETH Zurich and specialised in information security during my master studies.
Currently, I work as a Junior Security Engineer at Futurae, an ETH Spin-off where we build secure and usable two-factor authentication. At SIB I teach the IT-Security course for their Chief Digital Officer postgraduate studies.
Before, I worked as a Web Engineer at UniversitätsSpital Zürich and ABZ, and was the webmaster for bauenschweiz.
I love to play the clarinet, swim in the Zürichsee, read books or play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons with friends.</description>
