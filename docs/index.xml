      <description>I studied computer science at ETH Zurich and specialized in Information Security during my master studies.
Currently, I work as a Security Engineer at Google. At SIB, I teach the IT-Security lecture as part of their Chief Digital Officer postgraduate studies.
Before, I worked as a Junior Security Engineer at Futurae, an ETH Spin-off where I helped building secure and usable Two-Factor Authentication. I also worked as a Web Engineer at UniversitätsSpital Zürich and ABZ and was the webmaster for bauenschweiz.</description>
